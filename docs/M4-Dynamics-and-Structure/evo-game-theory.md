## Classical game theory

The origin story of game theory has been told a million times. Here's one from Hank Green from back in the days that I like

You learn about the main categories of classical game theory being about cooperative or uncooperative games. Here we will get our hands dirty talking about the mathematics of game theory.

- Von Neuman
- Nash Equilibrium
- Three main ways to 
    1. Population genetics: 
        - discrete traits
    1. Quantitative genetics: 
        - continuous traits
    1. Game theory: 
        - discrete or continuous traits, emphasis on frequency-depencen (what you do depends on what  others might do). Ignore genetics details.

What is the best decision to make?

- Driving left or right? Best decision to make depends on everyone else.
- Split or steal.


Evolutionary game theory

- optimal choice depends on the choices of everyone else in the community
- Evolutionary area part refers to over time
- John Maynard Smith: evolution at phenotypic level when fitness depends on their frequencies in the population

  You should really try it out. It is an amazingly well designed game to teach about social dilemma using game theory. It teaches you about the power of repeated game to explain soldiers in trenches making temporary peace during WWI. But also how we can get an epidemy of distrust in a world without close friends or when mistakes are made.

### Life as a pika

- Optimal time of reproduction: balancing selective pressures of early season snowfall and competition for territories. 
- Pairwise invsability plot

### Can evolutionary suicide actually occur?

- Transgenic males given growth hormoes lareger than wild individuals. Females prefer to mate with larger individuals.

Easily the most time-effective introduction to modern evolutionary game theory you could ask for. Here's the first episode:

A book is coming out. You can find parts of it [here](https://github.com/rmcelreath/VLEGT?tab=readme-ov-file). There is a build up from conflict and cooperation to societies, passing through relationships and families along the way.
